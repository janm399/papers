      Amongst other things, a machine learning system should be built! It can solve anything, there are so many wonderful frameworks, so many conference talks that show just how easy it is to throw together just a few line of Python, and hey presto!--a machine that can recognise digits in images, recognise hot dog and \emph{not} hot dog... it even runs on a mobile phone. This essay is about the difficulties that are lurking in the execution and running of a robust \& mature machine learning system.
