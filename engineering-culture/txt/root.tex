      Many organisations say things like engineers work here not for the money, but for \emph{the great soda}, \emph{for the offices}, or \emph{for the beer o'clock on Fridays}. How is it possible that in some organisations these superficial measures appear to make a huge positive difference; while in other organisations they seem to either not make any difference at all, or sometimes make the morale and attitude worse?

\section{The hidden meaning}


The positive difference is when the soda or nice offices is understood to mean that \emph{the company values} its people; that beer o'clock means that \emph{the company trusts} its teams to make the right choices without explicit supervision \emph{and} when the other actions of the company align with the feeling of being valued and trusted\cite{joel-on-software}.

The negative or zero difference is when the the organisation does anything that the engineers find unfair, or when the policies suggest that the engineers are not actually being trusted. It is difficult to provide an exhaustive list of what makes one feel not valued or not trusted; though examples from a sample of 152 engineers in various organisations show the following top 5 reasons for not being valued or trusted in \autoref{tbl:not-valued-not-trusted}.
